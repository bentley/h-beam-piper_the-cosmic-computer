  <p class="block">Conn Maxwell told them: “There are incredible things still undiscovered; most of the important installations were built in duplicate as a precaution against space attack. I know where all of them are.<br/>
<br/>
“But I could find nothing, not one single word, about any giant strategic planning computer called Merlin!”<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless the leading men of the planet didn’t believe him. They couldn’t, for the search for Merlin had become their abiding obsession. Merlin meant everything to them: power, pleasures, and profits unlimited.<br/>
<br/>
